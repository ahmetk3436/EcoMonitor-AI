GUIDELINE COMPLIANCE SUMMARY
-----------------------------

1. NATIVE UTILITY (Guideline 4.2)
   - This is a native app built with React Native (Expo SDK 54), NOT a web wrapper.
   - Native features integrated:
     * Haptic feedback (expo-haptics) on all key interactions (login, errors, tab switches)
     * Biometric authentication (Face ID / Touch ID) via expo-local-authentication for secure session resumption (Settings > Security)
     * Secure token storage using expo-secure-store (hardware-backed encryption)
     * Native bottom tab bar navigation (Home, Settings)

2. SIGN IN WITH APPLE (Guideline 4.8)
   - Sign in with Apple is available on the login screen with equal visual prominence to email/password login.
   - Implementation: expo-apple-authentication
   - Apple user accounts are created server-side when a new Apple ID signs in.

3. USER-GENERATED CONTENT SAFETY (Guideline 1.2)
   - Every piece of user-generated content includes a "Report" button.
   - Report flow: User taps Report → selects reason → submits to backend → reviewed within 24 hours.
   - Block function: Users can block other users. Blocked content is immediately hidden client-side.
   - Content filtering: Server-side regex-based filter for prohibited content. (Augment with Perspective API for production.)
   - Admin moderation panel: GET /api/admin/moderation/reports (lists all pending reports)
   - Moderation SLA: All reports are processed within 24 hours via the admin endpoint.
   - Admin moderation endpoint: PUT /api/admin/moderation/reports/:id

4. MONETIZATION (Guideline 3.1)
   - All digital purchases use RevenueCat (StoreKit integration).
   - "Restore Purchases" button is present in Settings > Purchases.
   - No external payment links or "sign up on our website" text anywhere in the app.
   - RevenueCat webhook handler processes: INITIAL_PURCHASE, RENEWAL, CANCELLATION, EXPIRATION.

5. ACCOUNT DELETION (Guideline 5.1.1)
   - "Delete Account" button is in Settings > Danger Zone.
   - Requires password confirmation before deletion.
   - Server-side data scrub: removes all tokens, subscriptions, reports, blocks, and soft-deletes the user record.
   - Complies with Apple's requirement for full data erasure upon account deletion.

6. PRIVACY
   - No third-party analytics or tracking SDKs.
   - All authentication tokens are stored in secure hardware-backed storage (expo-secure-store).
   - Refresh tokens are stored as SHA-256 hashes in the database (even a DB breach doesn't compromise sessions).
   - JWT access tokens expire after 15 minutes.
   - All API communication uses HTTPS in production.

7. APP COMPLETENESS
   - No placeholder text ("Lorem Ipsum", "Coming Soon") anywhere in the UI.
   - All screens are fully functional.
   - Error states are properly handled with user-friendly messages.


TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
----------------------
- Backend: GoLang (Go-Fiber v2) with PostgreSQL (GORM ORM)
- Frontend: React Native (Expo SDK 54) with Expo Router and NativeWind (Tailwind CSS)

- In-App Purchases: RevenueCat webhook integration
